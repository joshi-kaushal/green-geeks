## About green-geeks
I developed this side project during my internship at [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/). Last year, HackerNoon organized a competition [Startup of the Year](https://hackernoon.com/just-launched-startups-of-the-year-lxg350j) in which startups from all around the globe participated. I aimed to visualise the data we received at the end of the contest.

## Features
- Pie-chart visualizing startups accoding to their regions

## Tech-stack
- **React** for front-end work
- **D3.js** for visualizing the pie chart
- **Codesandbox** as online code editor, since I wanted to collaborate with others in real time.

## How to Run Locally
Don't. Unless you have permissions from [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/contact) :)

## Live Deployment
