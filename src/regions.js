Airbase eliminates the resulting messy tech-stack and inefficient processes by replacing products like Expensify and Bill.com. Airbase empowers employees with a uniform approach to spending money, whether that involves corporate card spend, raising a PO, or requesting reimbursement.",

With the ability to hyperscale and connect to a host of cloud and developer tools, the company solves major pain points while empowering companies to create their own best products—adding unprecedented value to businesses. \n\nLogDNA is disrupting the market with cloud-based logging that focuses on superior developer experiences. As applications become more integrated into everyday life, the DevOps teams responsible for them are drowning in alerts and massive volumes of logs, wasting countless hours investigating and resolving issues instead of building new products that deliver business value. Other logging tools were built for legacy systems and apps with cloud capabilities bolted on. Born in the cloud and deployed within minutes, LogDNA gives developers rich context as well as complete control over and instant access to their logs. With simple, turnkey integrations with all major operating systems, languages, platforms, and best-in-class DevOps tools. LogDNA improves productivity and collaboration across all roles, eliminating data silos, and enabling autonomous teams.  \n\n\nLogDNA is the only logging provider to support Kubernetes Enrichment, which enables teams to debug deployment problems without separate tools or deep specialized knowledge by surfacing issues in a single view for seamless troubleshooting. \n\nThe platform’s value to modern cloud-native application development, along with new use cases in DevSecOps, are driving massive growth among hyper-growth startups and Fortune 500 companies alike. In 2020 alone, LogDNA experienced 155% YoY revenue growth, adding more than 800 customers around the world. LogDNA counts major brands—such as Asics, Better.com, SysDig, LaunchDarkly, and 6 River Systems—among its customers. To meet demand, the LogDNA team grew by more than 70% in the past year, including more than 65% growth in the product and engineering teams alone. ",

Our platform uses Unreal Engine 4 to generate ultra-realistic characters and virtual environments.\n\nArtificial intelligence allows SG avatars to learn from their users to become more accurate virtual representations. Within weeks, avatars can operate autonomously, meeting people based on your preferences, and engaging in new experiences.\n\nThe worlds of the Sensorium Galaxy are also home to a wide range of AI-powered non-player characters. Real users can meet, date, and interact with them at all times. AI technology makes NPCs highly realistic and allows them to dynamically adapt to user preferences to become their “ideal virtual companions” overtime.\n\nLocated at the epicenter of SG, PRISM is the world of music. A land where top performers gather to express themselves with absolute freedom. Join them and see how this land mutates under the influence of their art.\n\nLet your moves become your language. Connect with your senses through deep mindfulness & exciting dance performances to an underwater space. Dive into this mystic land to experience deep connections enabled by pure movements.",

Data analysts, scientist, and engineers have long held the keys to the data chest. But working across different systems and abilities has only widened the gap, making it hard for teams to share learnings with each other, let alone with their executives and stakeholders. A company might be swimming in data, but that doesn’t mean their teams are enabled to be data-driven. \n\nNoteable is on a mission to change that. Noteable is an early-stage startup that is tackling the widening gap in today’s modern enterprise data stack. The team behind Noteable has built some of the most sophisticated data tools in the world at industry-leading companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and Apple.\n\nBuilding on the success they’ve seen notebooks have in their own professional lives, the Noteable team is developing the first enterprise-grade notebook platform that enables every team to interact with data.",
